Composition intent and description:
- My goal with this was to create a really annoying but not totally predictable
    sound. To accomplish this, I needed it to start off normal/consistent (with
    the calming piano background to put the listener at ease), but a slight 
    annoyance (me saying hello repeatedly in the background) that seems to get 
    more annoying as the composition goes on. To interrupt the monotonous sound/
    consistent pattern, I added in the cash register noises and the part 4 
    arrpeggiated section. Also I kinda sound like that one BEN10 character, 
    which I included after watching 2 hours of Ben10 tiktok edits on tiktok 
    for some reason. Although this is only a 40 second sound, if you listened
    to it on loop for about 15-20 minutes like I did, it really does get quite
    annoying (especially the hello noises in the background).

Project feedback and pain points:
- I think a bit more scaffolding could have been provided. At a lot of points,
    I found myself a bit confused about how to go about completing the function. 
    The descriptions were very helpful, but a bit of helper code, especially when
    it comes to using specific numpy/pyquist things would go a long way. I spent
    a lot of time digging through/summarizing/reading about numpy and pyquist 
    resources, and at times I felt like I was just trying to plug in random/obscure
    helper functions that I didn't fully understand but thought would work. 

- Providing a bit more troubleshooting would be helpful - I spent several hours 
    dealing with a "module does not exist" 


Time spent per task:
- Project set up: 2 hr (initial setup was very easy, but I spent a long time 
                        dealing with a "module not found: librosa" error and 
                        ended up just having to delete and restart my virtual env
                        and reinstall all the libraries)
- Task 1: 1 hr
- Task 2: 2 hr
- Task 3: 2 hr (took a while to understand the whole json thing)
- Task 4: 1 hr
- Task 5: 2 hr
